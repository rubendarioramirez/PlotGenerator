Y no te preocupes, voy a poner nuevos todas las semanas.\n\nEl camino del heroe. Si no lo leiste, deberias correr a hacerlo! El hero de las mil caras es el legado que Joseph Campbell le dejo a los escritores. \nSin embargo, si queres refrescar la memoria, o si queres ir derecho a lo que significa, mira la seccion El camino del heroe, contiene todo lo que tenes que saber para comenzar o pulir tu historia.\n\nFeliz escritura!</string>
