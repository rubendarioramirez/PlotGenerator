    <string name="home_desc">If you love to write, then you\'re in the right place.\nI made this app because I also love writing as well but I know the struggle with writer\'s block, being lost or just losing focus.\nActually, I did this app for me but I believe it can also help you.\nThere are three things at the moment that you may find interesting.\n\nWriting prompts, whenever you\'re lost or you don\'t know how to start or how to continue, check them out. \nA simple sentence that will let your imagination fly away. And don\'t worry I\'ll post new ones weekly.\n\nThe Hero Journey. If you didn\'t read it, go running to get it! That\'s Joseph Campbell legacy for writers. \nHowever if you did read it and you want a refreshment, or you just want to go to the meat, check out The Hero Journey section, it contains all you have to know for your hero and it\'s journey.
        \n\nLast but not least, check out the workshop. It contains what you need to track and develop your characters. Create a project, then add characters and don\t worry if you are a bit block. I got your back with the generator function, that will generate traits, desires and needs for you.\n\nHave a great writing!</string>

    <string name="hj_desc1">The hero is presented with a problem, challenge or adventure.
The hero must face beginning of change.  This call must be accepted, this can happen willingly,
reluctantly, consciously or accidentally</string>
    <string name="hj_desc2">The hero doesn’t accept the call right away. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, such as being unwilling, being in denial or being kept from being able to respond.
The hero finds motivation and or opportunity to answer the call.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc3">The hero is now committed to the quest (consciously or unconsciously) and his guide/ helper becomes known.
Often, the mentor will present the hero with a talisman or artifact to aid him later in the quest.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc4">The hero crosses into the field of adventure, leaving behind all that is known and stepping into the unknown. Here, the limits, rules and limits are not yet known.
There is no going back, this is where the adventure gets going.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc5">The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the known world of the hero. In this stage, he shows willingness to undergo change and adaptation.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc6">This is a series of tests, tasks and ordeals that the hero must undergo in order to begin his transformation. Often the tests occur in threes and the hero usually fails one ore more.
Sometimes, the heroes lose their mentor in this stage (e.g. LOTR and Star Wars).</string>
    <string name="hj_desc7">The hero experiences a love that is all-powerful, encompassing and unconditional.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc8">The hero faces temptation (physical or pleasurable) which make lead him to stray from his mission or even abandon it. This temptation does not necessary come from a woman.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc9">The hero confronts the ultimate power in his life. This is the centre point of the story. All previous steps have brought him here and the steps to come move him away.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc10">There is a period of rest, peace and fulfilment before the hero begins his journey home.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc11">The achievement of the goal or quest. The hero gets what he came for.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc12">The hero may not want to return to the ordinary world.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc13">Sometimes the hero must escape with the artifact he came for (e.g. the holy grail) and others come after him to claim it back. In this case, the journey back can be just as dangerous and full of adventure.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc14">The hero often has (and needs) guides and helpers, sometimes the helpers are the one that need to bring him back to every day life. Especially if the hero has been severely wounded.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc15">Now that he gained all this knowledge and experience, he needs to retain it and integrate it into his human life and or share it with the world.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc16">This step occurs if the hero is a transcendental hero such as Jesus or Buddha. If the hero is human, this may be simply achieving a balance between the material and spiritual world. The hero becomes comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer world.</string>

    <string name="challenge_2_title">Challenge II</string>
    <string name="challenge_2_desc">What\'s the lie?</string>
    <string name="challenge_2_desc_long">The Change Arc is all about the Lie Your Character Believes. His life may be horrible, or his life may seem pretty great. But, festering under the surface, is the Lie.
In order for your character to evolve in a positive way, he has to start out with something lacking in his life, some reason that makes the change necessary. </string>
    <string name="challenge_2_q1">What misconception does your protagonist have about himself or the world?</string>
    <string name="challenge_2_q2">Is the Lie making his life miserable when the story opens? If so, how?</string>

That\'s what you\'re telling it. So what about his past? His past is why he is like this. Were his parents divorce? Perhaps his mother was an alcoholic, did his brother died in a tragic accident? Life events shape who we are. Dive in this challenge to fully develop your three-dimensional character.</string>

    <!--Fourth Challenge-->
    <string name="challenge_4_title">Challenge IV</string>
    <string name="challenge_4_desc">How he looks?</string>
    <string name="challenge_4_desc_long">Lajos Egri said that part of who you are, it\'s due to how you look. You don\'t believe it? Imagine your character was paralyzed when he was a kid, because of that he was all day long in his bed, so he couldn\'t do much as other kids, like playing outside. At the end he spent most of his time reading and learning new stuff. Odd for a normal kid, but the only life your character knew. Will he be different than other adults when he grows up? A bit smarter perhaps? Dive in to discover how your character looks like</string>
    <string name="challenge_4_q1">Take a moment to reflect. Jot down 5 adjectives that will describe your character physically</string>
    <string name="challenge_4_q2">Does he has any birth mark? Tattoos perhaps that will make him unique? </string>

    <string name="challenge_4_q4">Consider his posture a little bit, can you describe it? Also, what about his appearance? Is he neat? Is he tidy? Will you say he is overall good looking?</string>
    <!--Fifth Challenge-->
    <string name="challenge_5_title">Challenge V</string>
    <string name="challenge_5_desc">Test the limits.</string>
    <string name="challenge_5_desc_long">If coal and diamonds are basically the same thing, what make the coal so common and the diamond so rare?\n Pressure.\nSame is true in characters, do you want to know if your character is just one more in the crowd or is he the unique hero your story needs? Let\'s put pressure on him and find out who he really is.</string>
    <string name="challenge_5_q1">How would he react if someone he cares about is in danger?</string>
    <string name="challenge_5_q2">Will he be able to kill? </string>
    <string name="challenge_5_q3">Will your character say that the end justify the means when it\'s about protecting a loved one?</string>
    <string name="challenge_5_q4">Let\'s says he doesn\'t dare to cross his own limits to save the life a person he cares. What within his limits/boundaries will he do to solve the situation?</string>
    <!--Sixth Challenge-->
    <string name="challenge_6_title">Challenge VI</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_desc">What\'s in the pockets?</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_desc_long">Whatever you carry with you, speaks in a way about what you care. Will you carry something you don\'t care? You probably won\'t. Same it\'s true for your character. Dive in to discover what he/she has in the pockets, discover what he/she really cares about</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_q1">Your character it\s about to leave the house. What will he/she take and put in his pockets? Wallet? Keys? It\'s a car key? What car does she/he has?</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_q2">Open the wallet, is there a picture? Who is in the picture? Why it\'s there? Since when?</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_q3">Take the keys from his/her pocket, look carefully at the key chain. What is it? Where he/she got it? Was it a gift? Is it a country icon or flag? Which country?</string>
    <string name="challenge_6_q4">Does he/she carry a cellphone? Does it has battery? or it\'s always nearly empty when it\'s time to leave? Is the phone in silent mode? Look closer, what\'s the phone wall paper?</string>
    <!--Mentor Challenge-->
    <string name="c1_mentor_title">Mentor Challenge</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_desc">Know your mentor.</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_desc_long">Mentors are a rare type of characters. Not all the stories has one, but when they do, it has to be for a reason.\nWhat was Yoda motive to teach Luke Skywalker? Who put him on that swamp waiting to be discover? Did he only offered knowledge or also an artifact? Was this artifact the source of Luke\'s power? Dive in to find out about your mentor.</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_q1">Why your protagonist needs a mentor? Why this particular one, will be exactly what he needs?</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_q2">Will the mentor give knowledge to the protagonist? Or he will help him to discover himself?</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_q3">Will your protagonist power be unlocked by an artifact given by the mentor? If so, which power and which artifact?</string>
    <string name="c1_mentor_q4">Mentors die. As part of any dramatic journey, the mentor usually has to go a bit before the protagonist is actually ready. Or perhaps he is but he doesn\'t know it yet.\nAt which moment your mentor will leave or die? How will that be?</string>
    <!--Antagonist Challenge-->
    <string name="c1_antagonist_title">Antagonist Challenge</string>
    <string name="c1_antagonist_desc">Know your Antagonist.</string>
    <string name="c1_antagonist_desc_long">Stories are a power play. Nobody cares about the journey of "Mr I can do everything", if your protagonist is not facing some sort of obstacle that prevent him to get what he wants, then there is no challenge, and no challenge means no growth, which resumes to no story at all. However just adding obstacles for the sake of story is not a good practice either. Dig in to understand better who your antagonist really is, and what\'s his real role on your story</string>
    <string name="c1_antagonist_q1">The antagonist is the exact opposite of your protagonist. How in this case?</string>

        Each character in your story has to have a role that moves the story forward, from the protagonist to the antogonist, but that\'s not all. What about the sidekicks? Or the Mentors? Dive in here to learn more about character roles</string>

    </string-array>
    <string-array name="char_guide_types_desc">
        <item>It\'s the main character of the plot, things happen to him. He drives the action from the beginning to the end of the play, for instance. All stories have at least one main protagonist and , generally, this act motivated by his goal.</item>
        <item>It may be confused with the protagonist, however his role is to assist the protagonist to reach his objectives in the play, nothing else.</item>
        <item>It doesn\'t really appears in all the plays however, the sidekick can be seen in many different genres. He is the character that joins and accompany the protagonist on his victories or defeats, he will always help the protagonist on whatever it\'s needed, from physical to moral support. The sidekick, also is often devoted to the protagonist and will do whatever for him. It may even die.</item>
        <item>It\'s not a mandatory character neither the main one, however it shows up in many novels. Is the one that keeps somethings, it guards it (normally something pretty important and related to the protagonist goal) he will behave as an obstacle for the protagonist to reach his goal.</item>
        <item>Another not mandatory character however very strong when it\'s present. He is the Yoda of Star Wars, or the priest in Count of Montecristo. A character that will guide and transform the protagonist (The Hero) so he will be ready for the final battle, the one that he will have to fight to reach his objetives.</item>
        <item>The impact character is a secondary character with a brief show in the scene, but very important. Is about the character that in a given moment of the play, will give the protagonist the final push to keep going; or he may even give him a clue that he can use later (In the climax for instance) to solve something, to find the value he needs, or the clue to find the murder.</item>
        <item>In the other side of the table, we find a character that it\'s the exact opposite of the protagonist: The Antagonist or Villain of the story. This doesn\'t mean that the antagonist is always bad. However he has a complete opposite goal than the protagonist and he will fight till the end to reach it. With this clash of goals is where you find your conflict.</item>
        <item>Just as the protagonist, the Antagonist can have his helper. Better said, Characters that helps the Antagonist to reach his objectives. These are not mandatory characters, of course, but they can be very useful to create your plot.</item>
        <item>The skeptic character is the one that doesn\'t believe in the objectives of the protagonist. We could say, the opposite of the sidekick, he doesn\'t really put obstacles on the protagonist however he will try to demoralize him.</item>
        <item>These kind of characters are somehow similar to the Antagonist\'s helpers however they act more like jokers, characters that will pop up briefly to complicate or deviate the protagonist from his objective.</item>
        <item>Sometimes the goal of a Protagonist can be another character. For instance, somebody has been kidnapped and the protagonist has to find him. This character if he doesn\'t have any other function or role in the play, it can be consider the goal</item>

You must know why</string>
    <string name="lajos_text">There is only one realm in which characters defy natural laws and remain the same–the realm of bar writing.\n- Lajos Egri -\n\nA real an compelling character will always have three dimensions, failing to do so, will result in a unrealistic, uncompelling character whose purpose is just to be there as a filler.\nNot all characters have to have three dimensions is true, but at least you have to focus on the main ones.\n\nLajos Egri on his book "The Art of Dramatic Writing" wrote down three categories (hence the three dimensions) that your character has to have.\nTake a look below:\n\nPhysiology\n

    <string name="change_arc_title">Change Arc - K.M Weiland</string>
    <string name="change_arc_desc">How to create character\'s arcs?</string>
    <string name="change_arc_desc_long">Aristotle wrote that story was all about plot, however today we know that plot is all about how characters react to it. Will Indiana Jones react the same to a betrayal than Scarface? Can we assume that what\'s exciting for Batman
    maybe boring for Francis Underwood? Characters in same situations react completely differently\nDive in this section to learn more about how characters react to situations and how they change accordingly</string>
    <string-array name="change_arc_array_titles">
        <item>The Positive Arc</item>
        <item>The Flat Arc</item>
        <item>The Negative Arc</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="change_arc_array_desc">
        <item>This is the most popular and often the most resonant character arc. The protagonist will start out with varying levels of personal unfulfillment and denial. Over the course of the story, he will be forced to challenge his beliefs about himself and the world, until finally he conquers his inner demons (and, as a result, probably his outer antagonists as well) and ends his arc having changed in a positive way.</item>
        <item>Many popular stories feature characters who are already essentially complete unto themselves. They’re already heroes and don’t require any noticeable personal growth to gain the inner strength to defeat the external antagonists. These characters experience little to no change over the course of the story, making their arcs static or “flat.” Sometimes these characters are the catalysts for change in the story world around them, so that we find more prominent growth arcs in the minor characters.</item>
        <item>Negative character arcs offer, arguably, more variations that either of the other arcs. However, at their most basic level, the Negative Arc is just a Change Arc flipped on its head. Instead of a character who grows out of his faults into a better person, the Negative Arc presents a character who ends up in a worse state than that in which he began the story.</item>

    <string name="antagonist_guide_title">The anatomy of the perfect Antagonist</string>
    <string name="antagonist_guide_desc">How antagonists are made?</string>
    <string name="antagonist_guide_desc_long">Lajos Egri discuss in his book "The art of dramatic writing" the importance of Unity of Opposites. Meaning that if Batman wants order then the Joker wants chaos, if Gandalf wants peace, then Sauron wants war.
    Unity of opposites refers to the fact that both, the protagonist and the antagonist wants the exactly opposite and that\'s why they clash. Failing to apply this concept in your antagonist will make him boring or not realistic. Dig in to understand better how a good antagonists are made.</string>
    <string-array name="antagonist_guide_array_titles">
        <item>Antagonists are the exact opposite of your protagonist</item>
        <item>Antagonists are complex</item>
        <item>Antagonists are tough opponents</item>
        <item>The Antagonist has a strong motive</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="antagonist_guide_array_desc">
        <item>Quite often in literature, the antagonist is simply the opposite of the hero/protagonist. For example, if your protagonist is brash and hotheaded, then the antagonist is calm and very much in control of their emotions. The contrast between the two helps to create a compelling conflict and makes interactions more interesting.\n
        But beware, their opposition is not just in their tactics to reach their goals, it\'s deeper than that, it goes all the way to their nature, in a way that the ultimate battle among them it\'s unavoidable since the first line of your story.</item>
        <item>As tempting as it might be, do not make your antagonist the epitome of evil. Why not? Because it\'s boring and unrealistic. How many people have you met in your life that are absolutely evil? Probably zero. No matter how wicked someone is, you can always find some redeeming quality in their character.\n
        Give your antagonist some good qualities and show them in a positive light during some scenes/chapters. This will create a sharp contrast when they inevitably act upon their evil desires and whatever they do will seem even more terrible than it would have if you had portrayed them as a purely evil being.\n
        To give your antagonist even more depth, explore their background. Was he once a good person? Had he always have evil tendencies? What happened to him to be so hateful? Adding those layers to your antagonist will allow your reading be also compelled about your antagonist and truly believe your play.</item>
        <item>There is no play if your antagonist is not at least as strong as your protagonist. In fact, many great plays starts from the other end, it\'s the protagonist who has to grow their skills in order to match the evil antagonist. Failing to have a powerful antagonist in your play will result in a boring clash and a boring play as there is no actual challenge for the protagonist.
        Make youre antagonist perform truly despicable actions and if possible you may also want your protagonist to lose a couple of battles before the last one, when he show us how far he went to defeat the antagonist.</item>
        <item>What\'s the goal of your antagonist? What is the purpose behind all of the trouble that they are causing? Don\'t be tempted to explain that their wicked deeds are simply a product of their evil nature. People don\'t just randomly do bad things. They usually have a reason for their actions. Come up with a strong motivation and your character becomes that much more believable.</item>
