    <string name="home_tab">Home</string>
    <string name="home_header">Focus on writing...</string>
    <string name="home_desc">If you love to write, then you\'re in the right place.\nI made this app because I also love writing as well but I know the struggle with writer\'s block, being lost or just losing focus.\nActually, I did this app for me but I believe it can also help you.\nThere are three things at the moment that you may find interesting.\n\nWriting prompts, whenever you\'re lost or you don\'t know how to start or how to continue, check them out. \nA simple sentence that will let your imagination fly away. And don\'t worry I\'ll post new ones weekly.\n\nThe Hero Journey. If you didn\'t read it, go running to get it! That\'s Joseph Campbell legacy for writers. \nHowever if you did read it and you want a refreshment, or you just want to go to the meat, check out The Hero Journey section, it contains all you have to know for your hero and it\'s journey.
        \n\nLast but not least, check out the workshop. It contains what you need to track and develop your characters. Create a project, then add characters and don\t worry if you are a bit block. I got your back with the generator function, that will generate traits, desires and needs for you.\n\nHave a great writing!</string>

    <string name="hj_desc1">The hero is presented with a problem, challenge or adventure.
The hero must face beginning of change.  This call must be accepted, this can happen willingly,
reluctantly, consciously or accidentally</string>
    <string name="hj_desc2">The hero doesn’t accept the call right away. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, such as being unwilling, being in denial or being kept from being able to respond.
The hero finds motivation and or opportunity to answer the call.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc3">The hero is now committed to the quest (consciously or unconsciously) and his guide/ helper becomes known.
Often, the mentor will present the hero with a talisman or artifact to aid him later in the quest.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc4">The hero crosses into the field of adventure, leaving behind all that is known and stepping into the unknown. Here, the limits, rules and limits are not yet known.
There is no going back, this is where the adventure gets going.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc5">The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the known world of the hero. In this stage, he shows willingness to undergo change and adaptation.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc6">This is a series of tests, tasks and ordeals that the hero must undergo in order to begin his transformation. Often the tests occur in threes and the hero usually fails one ore more.
Sometimes, the heroes lose their mentor in this stage (e.g. LOTR and Star Wars).</string>
    <string name="hj_desc7">The hero experiences a love that is all-powerful, encompassing and unconditional.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc8">The hero faces temptation (physical or pleasurable) which make lead him to stray from his mission or even abandon it. This temptation does not necessary come from a woman.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc9">The hero confronts the ultimate power in his life. This is the centre point of the story. All previous steps have brought him here and the steps to come move him away.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc10">There is a period of rest, peace and fulfilment before the hero begins his journey home.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc11">The achievement of the goal or quest. The hero gets what he came for.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc12">The hero may not want to return to the ordinary world.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc13">Sometimes the hero must escape with the artifact he came for (e.g. the holy grail) and others come after him to claim it back. In this case, the journey back can be just as dangerous and full of adventure.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc14">The hero often has (and needs) guides and helpers, sometimes the helpers are the one that need to bring him back to every day life. Especially if the hero has been severely wounded.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc15">Now that he gained all this knowledge and experience, he needs to retain it and integrate it into his human life and or share it with the world.</string>
    <string name="hj_desc16">This step occurs if the hero is a transcendental hero such as Jesus or Buddha. If the hero is human, this may be simply achieving a balance between the material and spiritual world. The hero becomes comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer world.</string>

        <item>Goal</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="char_guide_types_desc">
        <item>It\'s the main character of the plot, things happen to him. He drives the action from the beginning to the end of the play, for instance. All stories have at least one main protagonist and , generally, this act motivated by his goal.</item>
        <item>It may be confused with the protagonist, however his role is to assist the protagonist to reach his objectives in the play, nothing else.</item>
        <item>It doesn\'t really appears in all the plays however, the sidekick can be seen in many different genres. He is the character that joins and accompany the protagonist on his victories or defeats, he will always help the protagonist on whatever it\'s needed, from physical to moral support. The sidekick, also is often devoted to the protagonist and will do whatever for him. It may even die.</item>
        <item>It\'s not a mandatory character neither the main one, however it shows up in many novels. Is the one that keeps somethings, it guards it (normally something pretty important and related to the protagonist goal) he will behave as an obstacle for the protagonist to reach his goal.</item>
        <item>Another not mandatory character however very strong when it\'s present. He is the Yoda of Star Wars, or the priest in Count of Montecristo. A character that will guide and transform the protagonist (The Hero) so he will be ready for the final battle, the one that he will have to fight to reach his objetives.</item>
        <item>The impact character is a secondary character with a brief show in the scene, but very important. Is about the character that in a given moment of the play, will give the protagonist the final push to keep going; or he may even give him a clue that he can use later (In the climax for instance) to solve something, to find the value he needs, or the clue to find the murder.</item>
        <item>In the other side of the table, we find a character that it's the exact opposite of the protagonist: The Antagonist or Villain of the story. This doesn\'t mean that the antagonist is always bad. However he has a complete opposite goal than the protagonist and he will fight till the end to reach it. With this clash of goals is where you find your conflict.</item>
        <item>Just as the protagonist, the Antagonist can have his helper. Better said, Characters that helps the Antagonist to reach his objectives. These are not mandatory characters, of course, but they can be very useful to create your plot.</item>
        <item>The skeptic character is the one that doesn\'t believe in the objectives of the protagonist. We could say, the opposite of the sidekick, he doesn\'t really put obstacles on the protagonist however he will try to demoralize him.</item>
        <item>These kind of characters are somehow similar to the Antagonist\'s helpers however they act more like jokers, characters that will pop up briefly to complicate or deviate the protagonist from his objective.</item>
        <item>Sometimes the goal of a Protagonist can be another character. For instance, somebody has been kidnapped and the protagonist has to find him. This character if he doesn't have any other function or role in the play, it can be consider the goal</item>
